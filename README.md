I want to inventory what data I have in my Google Drive, including the file types, file sizes, and file links, so I can know what data I need to move when backing up my data.

So, I have to get the access to my google cloud.

Then, I get the file types, file sizes, and file links.

At last, I put the data together and form it in an excel for further analysis.
